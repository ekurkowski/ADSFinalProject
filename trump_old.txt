Dont like @SamuelLJacksons golf swing.  Not athletic. Ive won many club championships. Play him for charity!
Huge crowd expected tomorrow night! VT Police say first come, first serve. Arrive early!
I will be on @wolfblitzer for a @CNNSitRoom interview today. Please join us 5PM ET.
Do you believe that @UnionLeader in NH was demanding ads? Look at enclosed letter from them, just received:
The failing @UnionLeader newspaper in N.H. just sent The Trump Organization a letter asking that we take ads. How stupid, how desperate!
.@Macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the S and P last year, plunging 46%. Very disloyal company. Another win for Trump! Boycott.
It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago. Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted!
I will be in beautiful Burlington, Vermont, tonight for a rally. Will be great fun. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Man shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level. Germany is a total mess-big crime. GET SMART!
Massive crowd in VT tonight. Venue not big enough. Officials say NO to outside event and sound system. Arrive early!
.@SenTedCruz Ted--free legal advice on how to pre-empt the Dems on citizen issue. Go to court now and seek Declaratory Judgment--you will win!
I have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster. Try using your last name and don't be ashamed of it!
Weak and ineffective @JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. False advertising!
Hillary and her friends!
The @TheView @ABC, once great when headed by @BarbaraJWalters, is now in total freefall. Whoopi Goldberg is terrible. Very sad!
Joy Behar, who was fired from her last show for lack of ratings, is even worse on @TheView. We love Barbara!
I'm leaving now for Burlington, Vermont. It will be wild!
We could only get a small fraction of this 25k crowd in. The movement to Make America Great Again is unbelievable!
Great time in Burlington, Vermont. Crowd was amazing.

Remember, get TIME magazine! I am on the cover. Take it out in 4 years and read it again! Just watch...
I am pleased to announce that I had the Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate.
If their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isnt questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who cant win.
This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed.
UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows. They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH.
Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog. For starters, try getting a new publisher!
Thank you to our law enforcement officers! #LESM #Trump2016

The Iran deal is terrible. Why didn't we get the uranium stockpile - it was sent to Russia. #SOTU
The #SOTU speech is really boring, slow, lethargic - very hard to watch!
Just found out that @tedcruz is spending a fortune on Iowa push polls negative to me. Not nice, but OK! New polls are great.
The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time. New leadership fast!
Numerous polls have me beating Hillary Clinton. In a race with her, voter turnout will be the highest in U.S. history-I get most new voters!
Iran toys with U.S. days before we pay them, ridiculously, billions of dollars. Don't release money. We want our hostages back NOW!

More radical Islam attacks today - it never ends! Strengthen the borders, we must be vigilant and smart. No more being politically correct.
Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so
Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable
Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!
The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!
Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.
Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian," did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?
Ted Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!
Great new numbers. Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
Ted is the ultimate hypocrite. Says one thing for money, does another for votes.
If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage, why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?
Everybody that loves the people of New York, and all they have been thru, should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!
When will @TedCruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him.
Greatly dishonest of @TedCruz to file a financial disclosure form and not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St
Departing NH now- great morning with record crowd in Portsmouth- in a snow storm! Thank you!
Wow! Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions, $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul, and $1M low int. loan from Goldman Sachs. Hypocrite
Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about and demeaning?
Interesting read from Peggy Noonan.
In Iran deal we get 4 prisoners. They get $150 billion, 7 most wanted and many off watch list. This will create great incentive for others!
Iran is going to buy 114 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving them...but they won't buy from U.S., rather Airbus!
Big announcement in Ames, Iowa on Tuesday! You will not want to miss this rally! #Trump2016
Far more killed than anticipated in radical Islamic terror attack yesterday. Get tough and smart U.S., or we won't have a country anymore!
I am self-funding my campaign - putting up my own money, not controlled.  Cruz is spending $millions on ads paid for by his N.Y. bosses.
"@pbralick: @BenKissel great on @greggutfeld @GregGutfeldShow @JoNosuchinsky too"  Thank you Ben for your nice comments on debate!
Thank you @IvankaTrump for the kind words. I am very proud of the role model you are for so many. NH and IA radio ad:
Just a reminder that Ted Cruz supported liberal Justice John Roberts who gave us #Obamacare.

Ted Cruz is falling in the polls. He is nervous. People are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks!
I don't think Ted Cruz can even run for President until he can assure Republican voters that being born in Canada is not a problem. Doubt!

National Review is a failing publication that has lost it's way. It's circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low. Sad!
Very few people read the National Review because it only knows how to criticize, but not how to lead.

Ted Cruz went down big in just released Reuters poll - what's going on? Is it Goldman Sachs/Citi loans or Canada?
Just watched Jeb's ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him. Jeb --- mom can't help you with ISIS, the Chinese or with Putin.
.@BrentBozell, one of the National Review lightweights, came to my office begging for money like a dog. Why doesn't he say that?
The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad!
Cruz says I supported TARP, which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs, the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. Puppet!
Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS. He could be Canadian Prime Minister.
Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. and is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi, low interest loans. No legal disclosure and never sold off assets.

I refuse to call Megyn Kelly a bimbo, because that would not be politically correct. Instead I will only call her a lightweight reporter!
The statement put out yesterday by @FoxNews was a disgrace to good broadcasting and journalism. Who would ever say something so nasty and dumb
Just got to listen to Rush Limbaugh - the guy is fantastic!
Even though I beat him in the first six debates, especially the last one, Ted Cruz wants to debate me again. Can we do it in Canada?
I am self funding my campaign so I do not owe anything to lobbyists and special interests.
I will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00 P.M. (Eastern). Enjoy!
It was the childishly written and taunting PR statement by Fox that made me not do the debate, more so than lightweight reporter, @megynkelly.

.@BenSasse looks more like a gym rat than a U.S. Senator. How the hell did he ever get elected?  @greta
Amazing that Ted Cruz can't even get a Senator like @BenSasse, who is easy, to endorse him. Not one Senator  is endorsing Canada Ted!
.@FoxNews is the only network that does not even mention my very successful event last night. $6,000,000 raised in one hour for our VETS.

The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters "in violation." They are now under investigation. Bad!
.@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and dishonest guy. Asked me for expensive hotel rooms, free (and more). I said pay and he endorsed Cruz!
.@bobvanderplaats asked me to do an event. The people holding the event called me to say he wanted $100,000 for himself.Phony @foxandfriends
.@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and con man. When I wouldn't give him free hotel rooms and much more, he endorsed Cruz. @foxandfriends
I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife, Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State!
Ted Cruz is totally unelectable, if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN!
Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans, scam!
Wow, just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me, will repeal and replace. He lies!
By not doing the failed, poorly rated debate, I was able to make the point of not allowing "unfairness" - while raising $6,000,000 for VETS.
If I would have done the last debate, a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also, VETS got $6,000,000.

My experience in Iowa was a great one. I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place. Nice
Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa, I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz and Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor
The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history!
I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire. Big crowd
I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign, the only one. I will keep doing, but not worth it!

Great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany  @cherijacobus begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy! @CNN
Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!
During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.
Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.
The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud
And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie!
Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.
I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! @FoxNews
This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #CruzFraud
The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!
Cruz just lied again- I am, and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace!
Dr. Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for "deceit and dirty tricks and lies."
Thank you New Hampshire! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #FITN
Stop the assault on American values. Stand w/ Trump to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!#VotersSpeak:

Thank you @billoreilly and @KarlRove. Ted Cruz should be immediately disqualified in Iowa, with each candidate moving up one notch.
#ICYMI: @KarlRove and @oreillyfactor discuss what Ted Cruz did to the great people of Iowa- as they went to vote.
.@oreillyfactor @KarlRove- as per the show, an even more serious Cruz charge is the fraudulent voter violation certificate sent to everyone.
This is the Cruz voter violation certificate sent to everyone, a misdemeanor at minimum.

Jeb Bush is desperate - strongly in favor of #CommonCore and very weak on illegal immigration.

I know the "Governors" and Jeb Bush, who has gone nasty with lies, is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain!
No-one has done more for people with disabilities than me. I have spent many millions of dollars to help out-and am happy to have done so!

Nothing conservative about the Club for Growth coming into my office and demanding a $1M contribution, which naturally, they did not get.
After hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1M from me, they went hostile w/ a series of incorrect and ill-informed ads.
Lightweight @JebBush is spending a fortune of special interest against me in SC. False advertising- desperate and sad!
If @TedCruz doesnt clean up his act, stop cheating, and doing negative ads, I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen.
Last time lightweight @JebBush tried to knock off @marcorubio he made a total fool of himself. If he doesn't do better this time, he is out!

Love the people of South Carolina - look very much forward to the debate tonight.
The totally unexpected loss of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is a massive setback for the Conservative movement and our COUNTRY!
Wow! Honored to be chosen by the highly respected + accurate Washington and Lee Mock Convention. I hope you are right - I will make you proud!
Nasty Ted Cruz is at it again- same dirty tricks he used w/ @RealBenCarson- saying I may not be on ballot and I hold liberal positions. LIES!
Ted Cruz is a cheater! He holds the Bible high and then lies and misrepresents the facts!
On the way to the #GOPDebate with my wonderful wife @MelaniaTrump.
Lightweight @JebBush said tonight he didn't know his family used private eminent domain in Texas- Lie! #GOPDebate
Thank you! I miss my father.
How can @JebBush beat Hillary Clinton- if he can't beat anyone else on the #GOPDebate stage with $150M? I am the only one who can!
All polls have me winning debate big- Drudge, TIME, etc. Dopey Charles Krauthammer still nasty. He has zero cred- totally dishonest!
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
Hey @glennbeck- see how I beat your boy Ted- in your own Blaze poll? Your endorsement means nothing! #GOPDebate
#GOPDebate #GoogleTrends
"@jeffpaine:  @realDonaldTrump you crushed the debate! Thank you!
Even though every poll, Time, Drudge etc., has me winning the debate by a lot, @FoxNews only puts negative people on. Biased - a total joke!
"@autumnandews08: @realDonaldTrump @JebBush Jeb is incompetent and will lose, don't waste your energy on that cry baby!"
This shows what a complete and total liar Ted Cruz is- he said he wouldn't have nominated John Roberts. Really?
I will be on Face the Nation with John Dickerson on CBS this morning. Enjoy!
Thank you for your support! TOGETHER we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Loved the debate last night, and almost everyone said I won, but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. All donors and special ints
Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists and special interests - the bosses!
Wow, in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties! Thank you!
Ted Cruz, along with Jeb Bush, pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice, but didn't!
Funny that Jeb(!) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.Then mommy, now brother!
Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates, Hillary would destroy them. Ted may not be eligible to run - born in Canada
I will be in South Carolina all week. Saturday is BIG, BIG, BIG! Get out and vote - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!), is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center, Iraq War and eco collapse? Careful!
I'd like to call JEB a liar, but the truth is he has no clue and never revealed that he used Eminent Domain- when criticizing me! (1/2)
Jeb used Eminent Domain and took advantage of a disabled vet in the process. (2/2)
JEB is a hypocrite! Used massive private "Eminent Domain" --- Just another clueless politician!

Just out Nevada poll shows Jeb Bush at 1%, he should take his dumb mouthpiece, @LindseyGrahamSC, and just go home.
Jeb Bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses. He wants to look cool, but it's far too late. 1% in Nevada!

I was asked about healthcare by Anderson Cooper and have been consistent- I will repeal all of #ObamaCare, including the mandate, period.
I was referring to a backstop for pre-existing conditions. I will eliminate the law, in its entirety, and replace it w/ something much better.
I will replace it with private plans, health savings accounts, and allow purchasing across state lines. Maximum choice and freedom for consumer.
Im self-funding and I am going to take care of the people  not the special interests and insurance companies like the other candidates.
Remember, Cruz and Bush gave us Roberts who upheld #ObamaCare twice! I am the only one who will #MAKEAMERICAGREATAGAIN!

It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve, and yet Ted Cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done.
Wow, Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director. More dirty tricks!
Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact. Take ad down Ted. Biggest liar in politics!
Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support!

Ted Cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in Iowa. Weak RNC and Republican leadership probably won't let this happen! Sad.

Ted Cruz does not have the right "temperment" to be President. Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm. BAD!

"@JoeNBC: Marco Rubio just criticized Ted Cruz for underperforming tonight. Wow. #SuperTuesday"
"@JoeNBC: FOX calls Virginia for Trump. If it holds, it's a big win for Trump and a big setback for Rubio, who needed to win the state.
The special interests and people who control our politicians (puppets) are spending $25 million on misleading and fraudulent T.V. ads on me.
Why would anyone in Florida vote for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. Check out his credit card scam, his house sale and his no show voting!
Marco Rubio lost big last night. I even beat him in Virginia, where he spent so much time and money. Now his bosses are desperate and angry!
"@KinnardJan: @Itsjoeco @realDonaldTrump I took Trump University class and saved my home!"
My wife @MELANIATRUMP will be #OnTheRecord w/ @greta tonight at 7pmE on @FoxNews. Enjoy!
Why can't the leaders of the Republican Party see that I am bringing in new voters by the millions-we are creating a larger, stronger party!
"@HavBat22: @TeamCavuto #KenLangone is 100% correct #NeilCavuto. And u and the rest of u #Fox muppets refuse to HEAR HIM." So true!
.@CNN poll just hit 49% for Trump. Interesting how my numbers have gone so far up since lightweight Marco Rubio has turned nasty. Love it!
I am going to repeal and replace ObamaCare! Read more about my positions on healthcare reform here:
Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney is having a news conference tomorrow to criticize me. (1/2)
Just another desperate move by the man who should have easily beaten Barrack Obama. (2/2)
I would love to see the Republican party and everyone get together- and unify.Video:

Because of me, the Republican Party has taken in millions of new voters, a record. If they are not careful, they will all leave. Sad!
"@Johnsmi01433966: The establishment doesn't like you because they can't control you and get you to lie to us and keep ripping us off."
Millions of dollars being spent on false TV ads by special interest groups who own Rubio and Cruz.When you see them think of your puppet POLS
Looks like two-time failed candidate Mitt Romney is going to be telling Republicans how to get elected. Not a good messenger!
"@malski1954: I changed parties to vote for you, no one else measures up to you, The GOPe needs a reality check. Our country is at stake"
Failed candidate Mitt Romney,who ran one of the worst races in presidential history,is working with the establishment to bury a big "R" win!
I have brought millions of people into the Republican Party, while the Dems are going down. Establishment wants to kill this movement!
Why would the great people of Florida vote for a guy who, as a Senator, never even shows up to vote - worst record. Marco Rubio is a joke!
I am the only one who can beat Hillary Clinton. I am not a Mitt Romney, who doesn't know how to win. Hillary wants no part of "Trump"
Why did Mitt Romney BEG me for my endorsement four years ago?
The phony lawsuit against Trump U could have been easily settled by me but I want  to go to court. 98% approval rating by students. Easy win
"@CreativeXwalk: @realDonaldTrump teaching the GOP how to lose four years ago was not enough. Now Romney wants to do it again."

Great time last night in Louisiana. Big and energetic crowd. Go out and vote now, polls open. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
For all of today's voters please remember that I am the only candidate that is self funding my campaign, I am not bought and paid for!
Wow, big lines in Kansas.
Will be in Orlando, Florida, this afternoon. 25,000 people expected. This is a movement like our GREAT COUNTRY has never seen before!
Why would anyone in Kentucky listen to failed presidential candidate Rand Paul re: caucus. Made a fool of himself (1%.)KY his 2nd choice!
To the people of Kentucky, Rand Paul didn't want you. Now he runs back due to his presidential failure. #VoteTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Thank you Kansas! Thousands of people inside- and thousands outside who couldn't get into the hall. Really amazing! #CaucusForTrump

All of the phony T.V. commercials against me are bought and payed for by SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS, the bandits that tell your pols what to do
How do you fight millions of dollars of fraudulent commercials pushing for crooked politicians? I will be using Facebook and Twitter. Watch!
Failed presidential candidate Lindsey Graham should respect me. I destroyed his run, brought him from 7% to 0% when he got out. Now nasty!
Lindsey Graham is all over T.V., much like failed 47% candidate Mitt Romney. These nasty, angry, jealous  failures have ZERO credibility!
We cannot let the failing REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT, who could not stop Obama (twice), ruin the MOVEMENT with millions of  $'s in false ads!
I will be using Facebook and Twitter to expose dishonest lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. A record no-show in Senate, he is scamming Florida
Congratulation to Adam Scott and all of the folks at Trump National Doral on producing a really great WGC Tournament. Amazing finish!
Leaving for North Carolina. Big crowd, will be fun!
Don't believe the millions of dollars of phony television ads by lightweight Rubio and the R establishment. Dishonest people!
It was great being in Michigan. Remember, I am the only presidential candidate who will bring jobs back to the U.S.and protect car industry!

Ted Cruz Was For Welcoming Syrian Refugees Before He Was Against It

The organized group of people, many of them thugs, who shut down our First Amendment rights in Chicago, have totally energized America!
Absentee Governor Kasich voted for NAFTA and NAFTA devastated Ohio - a disaster from which it never recovered. Kasich is good for Mexico!
Ohio had the biggest budget increase in the U.S. If it were not for striking oil, they would be bust! Governor Kasich in favor of TPP fraud!
The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled. Will be great - love you Ohio!
On my way to Dayton, Ohio. Will be there soon!

Thank you Dayton, Ohio! 20,000 supporters- largest in airport history! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
Word is-early voting in FL is very dishonest. Little Marco, his State Chairman, and their minions are working overtime-trying to rig the vote.
We are asking law enforcement to check for dishonest early voting in Florida- on behalf of little Marco Rubio. No way to run a country!
The last person that Hillary or Bernie want to run against is Donald Trump --- and that is fact!
It is Clinton and Sanders people who disrupted my rally in Chicago - and then they say I must talk to my people. Phony politicians!
Just finished my second speech. 20K in Dayton and 25K in Cleveland- perfectly behaved crowd. Thanks- I love you, Ohio!
#EndCommonCore #Trump2016Video:
Do the people of Ohio know that John Kasich is STRONGLY in favor of Common Core! In other words, education of your children from D.C. No way
USSS did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. He has ties to ISIS. Should be in jail!
Wow, Kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of Pennsylvania, not enough signatures. Big problem!
"@alextrent4: It is repulsive that Trump was assaulted+politicians used that 2 further themselves+2 further victimize Trump! DISGUSTING!!"
Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours!
Ohio Gov.Kasich voted for NAFTA, from which Ohio has never recovered. Now he wants TPP, which will be even worse. Ohio steel and coal dying!
Gov.Kasich of Ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television, he only watches the @GolfChannel
Thank you Kevin. With unification of the party, Republican wins will be massive!
Carly Fiorina- I agree! Ted Cruz is just another politician. All talk- no action!
Because Gov. Kasich cannot run in the state of Pennsylvania-he cannot win the nomination- and should not be allowed to compete in Ohio on Tue.
The failing @nytimes is truly one of the worst newspapers. They knowingly write lies and never even call to fact check. Really bad people!
LYIN' TED

Kasich voted for NAFTA, a disaster for Ohio, and now wants the even worse TPP approved. Vote Trump and end this madness!
Rubio is weak on illegal immigration, with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I will bring our jobs back to America, fix our military and take care of our vets, end Common Core and ObamaCare, protect 2nd A, build WALL
Please remember, I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich, Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists!
Don't reward Mitt Romney, who let us all down in the last presidential race, by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA, open borders etc.).
Good morning Ohio! Some additional information from my daughter, @IvankaTrump! #VoteTrump #SuperTuesday
Just in, big news- I have been declared the winner of the CNMI Rep Caucus with 72.8% of the vote! Thank you! #SuperTuesday #VoteTrump
North Carolina lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs and Ohio lost 400,000 since 2000. Going to Mexico etc. NO MORE IF I WIN, WE WILL BRING BACK!
#VoteTrump #SuperTuesdayFloridaIllinoisMissouriNorth CarolinaOhio #TrumpTrain
Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate, until I put him down.
Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico, now losing Ford (and many others). Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now!
In presidential voting so far, John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him, I will beat Hillary!
I will bring our jobs back to the U.S., and keep our companies from leaving. Nobody else can do it. Our economy will "sing" again.
A lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in Florida? Hope this is false.
Word is that, despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads, I had a massive victory in Florida. Numbers out soon!

I will be interviewed on The O'Reilly Factor this evening at 8 pm on the Fox News Channel. @oreillyfactor
Stuart Stevens, the failed campaign manager of Mitt Romney's historic loss, is now telling the Republican Party what to do with Trump. Sad!
Crazy @megynkelly supposedly had lyin' Ted Cruz on her show last night. Ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse. Ted can't win!
Great news that @FoxNews has cancelled the additional debate. How many times can the same people ask the same question? I beat Cruz debating
Crazy @megynkelly is now complaining that  @oreillyfactor did not defend her against me - yet her bad show is a total hit piece on me.Tough!
The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem!
.@WSJ Editorial says "Clinton primary vote total is 8,646,551.Trump's is 7,533,692"-a knock. But she had only 3 opponents-I had 16.Apologize
.@WSJ is bad at math. The good news is, nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore, especially me!
Please explain to the dummies at the @WSJ  Editorial Board that I love to debate and have won, according to Drudge etc., all 11 of them!
See you in Arizona on Friday and Saturday.
Looking like my 5 victories on Tuesday will be just as good as if I won Ohio. Two more days and Ohio was mine!
Highly overrated and crazy @megynkelly is always complaining about Trump and yet she devotes her shows to me. Focus on others Megyn!
Who should star in a reboot of Liar Liar- Hillary Clinton or Ted Cruz? Let me know.

Hillary Clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life!

Lyin' Ted Cruz lost all five races on Tuesday-and he was just given the jinx - a Lindsey Graham endorsement. Also backed Jeb. Lindsey got 0!
Senator @LindseyGrahamSC made horrible statements about @SenTedCruz  and then he endorsed him. No wonder nobody trusts politicians!
.@EWErickson got fired like a dog from RedStateand now he is the one leading opposition against me.
With millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment, my numbers continue to go up. Can anyone explain this?
Club For Growth tried to extort $1,000,000 from me. When I said NO, they went hostile with negative ads. Disgraceful!
Club for Growth letter- trying to extort $1,000,000.00 from me. Remember, I said- NO!
Going to Salt Lake City, Utah, for a big rally. Lyin' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there - Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary
Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the man who "choked" and let us all down, is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me!
Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich and Marco Rubio, and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz. 1/2
Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost!
Join me tomorrow! #Trump2016#MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Thank you Arizona- I love you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
Everybody should boycott the @megynkelly show. Never worth watching. Always a hit on Trump! She is sick, and the most overrated person on tv.
Do you believe that Hillary Clinton now wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants? She should spend more time taking care of our great Vets!
I guess I have reached yet another "ceiling"  - 49.7%, with four people. My highest Reuters poll yet! Thank you!
Why haven't they released the final Missouri victory for us yet? Could it be because Cruz's guy runs Missouri?
Just leaving Salt Lake City, Utah- fantastic crowd with no interruptions. Love Utah- will be back!
Watching @loudobbsnews- fantastic show! Has very interesting take on Paul Ryan.

Great to be back in Arizona!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
Wow, @CNN ratings are up 75% because it's "all Trump, all the time." The networks are making a fortune off of me! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

"@GStephanopoulos: Whats @realDonaldTrump's strategy to secure the GOP nomination? Ill talk to the Republican front-runner. @ThisWeekABC."
Will be interviewed on @ThisWeekABC this morning. Enjoy!
Why is it that the horrendous protesters, who scream, curse punch, shut down roads/doors during my RALLIES,  are never blamed by media? SAD!
The protesters blocked a major highway yesterday, delaying entry to my RALLY in Arizona by hours, and the media blames my supporters!
So the highly overrated anchor, @megynkelly, is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show, but I can't fight back? Wrong!

"@MyPresidentme: Here's Trump #AIPAC2016 in case anyone missed it. It is a must watch.
Do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place Brussels was. Not anymore, it is from a different world! U.S. must be vigilant and smart!
President Obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in Cuba, especially in the shadows of Brussels. He is being treated badly!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody- and its not even close. Hopefully AZ and UT will be voting for me today!
Watch this clip from earlier this year. Time and time again I have been right about terrorism. Its time to get tough!
My heart and prayers go out to all of the victims of the terrible #Brussels tragedy. This madness must be stopped, and I will stop it.

Obama, and all others, have been so weak, and so politically correct, that terror groups are forming and getting stronger! Shame.
Pres. Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately and get home to Washington- where a #POTUS, under a serious emergency belongs!
Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!
Incompetent Hillary, despite the horrible attack in Brussels today, wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in.  No way!
Thank you, Arizona! #Trump2016#WesternTuesday #TrumpTrain
Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you, I will never forget!
Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November, paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices!
Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. That's why we call him Lyin' Ted!
Thank you, Arizona! #Trump2016#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrain
Lyin Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me, and lines from Michael Douglas just another dishonest politician.
Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates, Lyin Ted Cruz. Honestly, I cant blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion!
Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. Shes been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are!
I will be the best by far in fighting terror. Im the only one that was right from the beginning, and now Lyin Ted and others are copying me.
I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted. Jeb spent more than $150,000,000 and got nothing. I spent a fraction of that and am first!
While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates, it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race!
I want to thank @RealSheriffJoe for all of his help in our historic Arizona win. Could not have done it without you Joe!

N.A.T.O. is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on!
We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N.A.T.O. Why? It is time to renegotiate, and the time is now!
"@missi51: .@realDonaldTrump thank God is not a politician, but he's one heck of a fighter who will fight for us, the people."
It is amazing how @LindseyGrahamSC gets on so many T.V. shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly (ZERO) in his pres run!
.@LindseyGrahamSC and Lyin' Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike - ALL TALK AND NO ACTION! Both talk about ISIS, do nothing!
These politicians like Cruz and Graham, who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years, do nothing to make things better!
Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a "hell hole" and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article. I was so right!
It is amazing how often I am right, only to be criticized by the media. Illegal immigration, take the oil, build the wall, Muslims, NATO!

"@Doctor_S_Freud:  @TheView They're all brain-dead puppets with skeletons in their closet. I say you go on and destroy them all" A dead show

I didn't start the fight with Lyin'Ted Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania, he did. He knew the PAC was putting it out - hence, Lyin' Ted!

The media is so after me on women  Wow, this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump!
The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women, when they know that it is just the opposite!
Lyin' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq.were caused by me. I had NOTHING to do with story!
Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J. Trump. Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. Illegals out!
Wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in U.S., jobs are leaving. I will make our economy strong again - bring in jobs
Don't believe the @FoxNews Polls, they are just another phony hit job on me. I will beat Hillary Clinton easily in the General Election.
Remember, I am the only candidate who is self-funding. While I am given little credit for this by the voters, I am not bought like others!
I am interviewed on This Week on @ABC this morning. Enjoy!
Wow, sleepy eyes @chucktodd is at it again. He is do totally biased. The things I am saying are correct. - far better vision than the others
My statement on NATO being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive (and unfair) for the U.S. are now, finally, receiving plaudits!

Another radical Islamic attack, this time in Pakistan, targeting Christian women and children. At least 67 dead,400 injured. I alone can solve
Why can't the pundits be honest? Hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again. I will make it strong and great!  JOBS!
Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be, I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming

"Kirsten Powers: Anti- Trump Operative was Aggressively Shopping Cruz Story" via the Gateway Pundit:

Ted Cruz is incensed that I want to refocus NATO on terrorism, as well as current mission, but also want others to PAY FAIR SHARE, a must!
"@wolfblitzer:  Campaign-to-date popular GOP totals: @realDonaldTrump 7,546,980; @tedcruz 5,481,737; @JohnKasich 2,724,749" A BIG DIFFERENCE

"@PaulaDuvall2:  Cruz will say anything that is contrary to what you have to say. If you're for Motherhood, he'll be against it!"
After the way I beat Gov. Scott Walker (and Jeb, Rand, Marco and all others) in the Presidential Primaries, no way he would ever endorse me!
Lyin'Ted Cruz is weak and losing big, so now he wants to debate again. But, according to Drudge,Time and on-line polls, I have won all debates
Lyin' Ted, I have already beaten you in all debates, and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates. You should focus on jobs and illegal imm!
We need to secure our borders ASAP. No games, we must be smart, tough and vigilant. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN and MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN!
Wow, @CNN has nothing but my opponents on their shows. Really one-sided and unfair reporting. Maybe I shouldn't do their town-hall tonight!
I have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich, and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC.
How come the @TODAYshow and @chucktodd show the new @NBCNews Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz?
Wow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there!
Why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened, that is before she found out the episode was on tape?
Victory press conference was over. Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions? Can I press charges?
This was the reporters statement- when she found out there was tape from my facility, she changed her tune.
Why is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference? What is in her hand??

The Club For Growth,which asked me for $1,000,000 in an extortion attempt, just put up a Wisconsin ad with incorrect math.What a dumb group!
The Club For Growth said in their ad that 465 delegates (Cruz) plus 143 delegates (Kasich) is more than my 739 delegates. Try again!
The National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) said that our open border is the biggest physical and economic threat facing the American people!

Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary. Despite a rigged delegate system, I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him.
Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work!
Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. I am the one person she doesn't want to run against. Will be such fun!
I would have millions of votes more than Hillary except for the fact that I had 17 opponents and she just had a socialist named Bernie!
Thank you, California! Will see you soon! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Thank you for today's endorsement, New York Veteran Police Association! #NewYorkValues
"@DiamondandSilk: .@realDonaldTrump is who we need 2 fix this corrupted, rigged system. 4 no Profit, Under budget and ahead of schedule.
Lyin' Ted Cruz can't win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bosses-I am millions of VOTES ahead! Hillary would destroy him and K
Kasich only looks O.K. in polls against Hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed ZERO negative ads against him
New York, we will make America great again!
Lyin Ted Cruz even voted against Superstorm Sandy aid and September 11th help. So many New Yorkers devastated. Cruz hates New York!

I will be doing the @TODAYshow with my wife, Melania, and the rest of my family in a major Town Hall. Hopefully, it will be fun! Enjoy.7A.M.
Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!
Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!
Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted.
I met Prince on numerous occasions. He was an amazing talent and wonderful guy. He will be greatly missed!

Congratulations to @seanhannity on his great ratings and ratings increase as reported by the @AP today. Amazing job!
I had a great day campaigning in Connecticut. Looking for a big vote on Tuesday!
As soon as John Kasich is hit with negative ads, he will drop like a rock in the polls against Crooked Hillary Clinton. I will win!
.@Borisep was great on @JudgeJeanine tonight. Very smart commentary that will prove to be correct!

I am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing. It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. Becoming irrelevant!
Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!
Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors and special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!
Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!
Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.
Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work.
On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night!

Thank you Laura!
I am in Indiana where we just had a great rally. Fantastic people! Staying at a Holiday Inn Express - new and clean, not bad!
Getting the strong endorsement of the great coach, Bobby Knight, has been a highlight of my stay in Indiana. Big speech tomorrow with Bobby!
"@AnnetteJeanne: I cried when they said you made a clean sweep of all 5 states. I was SO HAPPY! I really adore you Mr. Trump, so much."
Thank you to all for the wonderful reviews of my foreign policy speech. I will soon be speaking in great detail on numerous other topics!

Crooked Hillary Clinton, perhaps the most dishonest person to have ever run for the presidency, is also one of the all time great enablers!
Thank you Indiana! #Trump2016

Crooked Hillary Clinton said she is used to "dealing with men who get off the reservation." Actually, she has done poorly with such men!
Gov Mike Pence has just stated that Donald Trump has taken a strong stance on Hoosier jobs, and he thanks me! I will bring back jobs to USA.
Everybody is talking about the protesters burning the American flags and proudly waving Mexican flags. I want America First - so do voters!
I will be campaigning in Indiana all day. Things are looking great, and the support of Bobby Knight has been so amazing. Today will be fun!

Wow, Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure - not very presidential. Sad!
Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will, and must, win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time and money
Thank you Indiana! #Trump2016#MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Thank you Indiana, we were just projected to be the winner. We have won in every category. You are very special people-I will never forget!
.@oreillyfactor  Please correct, I WON Virginia!
What a great evening we had. So interesting that Sanders beat Crooked Hillary. The dysfunctional system is totally rigged against him!

Can you believe Crooked Hillary said, "We are going to put a whole lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business." She then apologized.
Thank you West Virginia. Let's keep it going. Go out and vote on Tuesday - we will win big. #Trump2016
Unlike crooked Hillary Clinton, who wants to destroy all miners, I want wages to go up in America. We will do so by bringing back jobs!
Governor Rick Perry said "Donald Trump is one of the most talented people running for the Presidency I've ever seen." Thank you Rick!
So many great endorsements yesterday, except for Paul Ryan! We must put America first and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"@Ausbiz:  Many would say that you are the only talented person running for the top job this time! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrain"
Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special, the Republican Party. Wrong, I didn't inherit it, I won it with millions of voters!
Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability. As Bernie Sanders says, she has bad judgement. Constantly playing the women's card - it is sad!
Thank you to teachers across America! When I become POTUS we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now.
Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed, then John Kasich and that didn't work. Not much power or insight!
I hear @JoeNBC of rapidly fading @Morning_Joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run. This will guarantee a Crooked Hillary win.
Response to @LindseyGrahamSC:
I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.
Lets properly check goofy Elizabeth Warrens records to see if she is Native American. I say shes a fraud!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clintons flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.
Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy.
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.
Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.
Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk, no action -- maybe her Native American name?

Crooked Hillary Clinton says that she got more primary votes than Donald Trump. But I had 17 people to beatshe had one!
If I only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like Hillary Clinton, I would have gotten 10 million more votes than she did!
I will have set the all time record in primary votes in the Republican party --despite having to compete against 17 other people!
I am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate. Any negotiated increase by Congress to my proposal would still be lower than current!

Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U.S. Senate. She has done nothing!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren didnt have the guts to run for POTUS. Her phony Native American heritage stops that and VP cold.
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
Thanks Piers.
If the people of Massachusetts found out what an ineffective Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren has been, she would lose!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the womans card like her friend crooked Hillary. See her dumb tweet when a woman stands up to you
Our Native American Senator, goofy Elizabeth Warren, couldnt care less about the American workerdoes nothing to help!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage. See mediaasking for increase!
Isnt it funny when a failed Senator like goofy Elizabeth Warren can spend a whole day tweeting about Trump and gets nothing done in Senate?
In interview I told @AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I would release my tax returns when audit is complete, not after election!
If it were up to goofy Elizabeth Warren, wed have no jobs in Americashe doesnt have a clue.

That was an amazing interview on @foxandfriends - I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the @nytimes is!
The @nytimes is so dishonest. Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer, who said it was a lie!
Wow, Rowanne Brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday, was on @foxandfriends saying Times lied
A political commentator for @cnn, which I no longer watch, said "Trump showed some weakness in the Repub Primaries." I set all-time record!
With the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing @nytimes hit piece on me, we have exposed the article as a fraud!
Thank you, Anthony @Scaramucci @WSJ "The Entrepreneur's Case for Trump"
Rowanne Brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday joined @foxandfriends.
The failing @nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women.
No wonder the @nytimes is failingwho can believe what they write after the false, malicious and libelous story they did on me.
Over 50 women were interviewed by the @nytimes yet they only wrote about 6. Thats because there were so many positive statements.
The writer of the now proven false story in the @nytimes, Michael Barbaro, who was interviewed on CBS this morning, was unable to respond.
"In politics, and in life, ignorance is not a virtue." This is a primary reason that President Obama is the worst president in U.S. history!
I gave a woman named Barbara Res a top N.Y. construction job, when that was unheard of, and now she is nasty. So much for a nice thank you!
What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly, and for years, trying to come back. I said no.
"@AprilLaJune: OREGON votes today! Go vote for @realDonaldTrump and kick it BIG TIME!

Some low-life journalist claims that I "made a pass" at her 29 years ago. Never happened! Like the @nytimes story which has become a joke!
My list of potential U.S. Supreme Court Justices was very well recieved. During the next number of weeks I may be adding to the list!
Looks like yet another terrorist attack. Airplane departed from Paris. When will we get tough, smart and vigilant? Great hate and sickness!
How quality a woman is Rowanne Brewer Lane to have exposed the @nytimes as a disgusting fraud?  Thank you Rowanne.
Thank you @LtStevenLRogers. We will respond to terrorism with strength in 2017!
I said that Crooked Hillary Clinton is "not qualified" to be president because she has "very bad judgement" - Bernie said the same thing!
Crooked Hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina. ISIS, China, Russia and all would love for her to be president. 4 more years!
Look where the world is today, a total mess, and ISIS is still running around wild. I can fix it fast, Hillary has no chance!
Crooked Hillary Clinton looks presidential? I don't think so! Four more years of Obama and our country will never come back. ISIS LAUGHS!
Crooked Hillary can't even close the deal with Bernie - and the Dems have it rigged in favor of Hillary. Four more years of this? No way!

Thank you @TheTodaysGolfer for the wonderful statement that "the new par 3 9th hole @Trump Turnberry could be the most dramatic in Britain."
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment. No gun owner can ever vote for Clinton!
Crooked Hillary is spending tremendous amounts of Wall Street money on false ads against me. She is a very dishonest person!
While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day, the TSA is falling apart, just like our government! Airports a total disaster!
Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed. No more guns to protect Hillary!
"@RBacliff: Hillary wants to rip the guns out of America's hands. No guns = no protection. Get on #TrumpTrain and join @NRA to stop her."
.@CNN is so negative, getting even worse as I get closer. Just had two anti-Trump losers with zero rebuttal from my team. Turning off!

Crooked Hillary Clintons foreign interventions unleashed ISIS in Syria, Iraq and Libya. She is reckless and dangerous!

"@dubilujane: I trust @realDonaldTrump more anyone ever to protect America.He WILL do the right thing for the U.S.A, without a  doubt.
Crooked Hillary said that I  want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!
Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad! Would be four more years of stupidity!
Why do the networks continue to put dopey @BillKristol on panels when he has called every single shot about me wrong for 2 yrs?
How can Crooked Hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical Islam, which horribly oppresses women?
Crooked Hillary wants a radical 500% increase in Syrian refugees. We cant allow this. Time to get smart and protect America!
Join me on Wednesday, May 25th at the Anaheim Convention Center!#Trump2016 #MAGA Tickets:

In trade, military and EVERYTHING else, it will be AMERICA FIRST! This will quickly lead to our ultimate goal: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

While under no obligation to do so, I have raised between 5 and 6 million dollars, including 1million dollars from me, for our VETERANS. Nice!
Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed, with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups.
Amazingly, with all of the money I have raised for the vets, I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media.
I just released my financial disclosure forms, the largest numbers in the history of the F.E.C. Even the dishonest media thinks great!
Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates, overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs. Most importantly, she suffers from plain old bad judgement!
A great new book has been written about Crooked Hillary. Read it and you will never be able to vote for her. @Ed_Klein
A wonderfully written article concerning Israel by @JasonDovEsq
A suggestion for the dishonest media-
Thank you @DailyMail- for setting the failing @NYTimes story straight. This is what the NYT's should have written!
After raising, w/ no obligation, almost $6M for Vets, I couldn't believe protesters formed @ Trump Tower. JUST OUT- SENT BY CROOKED HILLARY!

Crooked Hillary Clinton just can't close the deal with Bernie. I had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates. Hillary doesn't have it
The protesters in New Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican flag. The rally inside was big and beautiful, but outside, criminals!
Thank you Washington! Honored to say, on behalf of our great movement, we have broken the all time record for votes in GOP primary history.

The U.S. has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders. How nice, but what do we get? NOT ENOUGH
I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary - by a lot - and with many states left to go! Thank you.
The failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style and that I don't have many people. I have 73, Hillary has 800- and I'm beating her.
The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money and get much better results! What we need as Prez!
I am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes, but when I won the GOP nomination, I'm in the back of the paper. Very dishonest!
Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me!
Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he's in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost. #MDW
Honor Memorial Day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country! We love them.
Heading to D.C. to see and hear ROLLING THUNDER. Amazing people that LOVE OUR COUNTRY. Great spirit!
Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do.
Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser, but if the GOP can't control their own, then they are not a party. Be tough, R's!
The Republican Party has to be smart and strong if it wants to win in November. Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate!
If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent, say good bye to the Supreme Court!
Obama says a WALL at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W.H.
In getting the endorsement of the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you), the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary!
The endorsement of me by the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate. Nice!

So many great things happening - new poll numbers looking good! News conference at 11:00 A.M. today, Trump Tower!
I have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great VETERANS, and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. Watch!
Just finished a press conference in Trump Tower wherein I gave information on which VETERANS groups got the $5,600,000 that I raised/gave!
So many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money I raised/gave! It was my great honor - they do an amazing job.

After the litigation is disposed of and the case won, I have instructed my execs to open Trump U(?), so much interest in it! I will be pres.
Crooked Hillary Clinton, who I would love to call Lyin' Hillary, is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions.
Crooked Hillary no longer has credibility - too much failure in office. People will not allow another four years of incompetence!
Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn't even look presidential!

Just like I have been able to spend far less money than  others on the campaign and finish #1, so too should our country. We can be great!
Crooked Hillary Clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. Her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions!
Crooked Hillary is being badly criticized (for a Wall Street paid for ad) by PolitiFact for a false ad on me on women. She is a total fraud!
A massive blow to Obama's message - only 38,000 new jobs for month in just issued jobs report. That's REALLY bad!

Really bad shooting in Orlando. Police investigating possible terrorism. Many people dead and wounded.
Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!
Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims and their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough, smart and vigilant?
Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness and vigilance. We must be smart!
Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace!

Based on the incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting of the record setting Trump campaign, we are hereby:
In my speech on protecting America I spoke about a temporary ban, which includes suspending immigration from nations tied to Islamic terror.
I thought people werent celebrating? They were cheering all over, even this savage from Orlando. I was right.
Saudi Arabia and many of the countries that gave vast amounts of money to the Clinton Foundation- cont'd:
Crooked Hillary says we must call on Saudi Arabia and other countries to stop funding hate. I am calling on- cont'd:

An: Media fell all over themselves criticizing what DonaldTrump "may have insinuated about @POTUS." But he's right:
The press is so totally biased that we have no choice but to take our tough but fair and smart message directly to the people!
I will be meeting with the NRA, who has endorsed me, about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list, or the no fly list, to buy guns.
Thank you Atlanta, Georgia! Will be back soon! #AmericaFirst

Donald Trump's Speech Is a Game Changer. #Trump2016
How can the NY Times show an empty room hours before my speech even started when they knew it was going to be packed? So totally dishonest!
Yesterday's failing @NYTimes fraudulently shows an empty room prior to my speech, when in fact, it was packed!
"@bfraser747: Watch out HillaryClinton  Support @realDonaldTrump   #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
.@DJohnsonPGA We are so proud of you Dustin. Your reaction under pressure was amazing. First of many Majors. You are a true CHAMPION!
When I said that if, within the Orlando club, you had some people with guns, I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees
Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament, according to new book, which is a mess!
I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton.
Hillary says this election is about judgment.  She's right.  Her judgement has killed thousands, unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy.
Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% asSecretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs.
How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk?
Hillary Clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans - and make everyone less safe.
Obama-Clinton inherited $10T in debt and turned it into nearly $20T.  They have bankrupted
I am "the king of debt."That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U.S.
Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays.
If you want to know about Hillary Clinton's honesty and judgment, ask the family of Ambassador Stevens.
Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State. She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich! Corrupt, dangerous, dishonest.
I will be interviewed by @LouDobbs tonight on @FoxBusiness 7pm ET
Crooked Hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief! She will be a disaster for jobs and the economy!
"@chrisboydbrew: @LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump @FoxBusiness.. Saw your interview.You are the best! Great questions, great answers" Lou is great
Hillary says things can't change. I say they have to change. It's a choice between Americanism and her corrupt globalism. #Imwithyou

"@justininglv: @realDonaldTrump great speech today!! It's all about America and that's why you will become president!!!!"  Thank you.
"@1lion: brilliant 3 word response to Hillary's 'I'm With You'  slogan  @realDonaldTrump
"@AllegrettiVicki: You have great children, future presidents...and we all see were raised right and out there for their father." Thank you.
Thank you to Donald Rumsfeld for the endorsement. Very much appreciated. Clinton's conduct has been "disqualifying."
"Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency."  --   Donald J. Trump
ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama."  --  Donald J. Trump
Hillary Lies to Benghazi Families#CrookedHillary
SC has kept us safe from exec amnesty--for now. But Hillary has pledged to expand it, taking jobs from Hispanic and African-American workers.
Hillary Clintons open borders are tearing American families apart. I am going to make our country Safe Again for all Americans. #Imwithyou
Obama and Clinton should stop meeting with special interests, and start meeting with the victims of illegal immigration.
On immigration, Im consulting with our immigration officers and  our wage-earners. Hillary Clinton is consulting with Wall Street.
Our inner cities have been left behind. We will never have the resources to support our people if we have an open border.
CNN, which is totally biased in favor of Clinton, should apologize. They knew they were wrong.
Here is another CNN lie. The Clinton News Network is losing all credibility. Im not watching it much anymore.
Read my full statement here on the Supreme Court's executive amnesty decision #imwithyou
Meet the amazing mother whose letter I read during my speech. She lost her son to policies supported by Clinton.
Leaving now for a one night trip to Scotland in order to be at the Grand Opening of my great Turnberry Resort. Will be back on Sat. night!
Congratulations to my son, Eric, on the fantastic job he has done in rebuilding Turnberry, and its great Ailsa Course. Always support kids!
Just arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote. They took their country back, just like we will take America back. No games!
Statement Regarding British Referendum on E.U. Membership
Getting ready to open the magnificent Turnberry in Scotland. What a great day, especially when added to the brave and brilliant vote.
Self-determination is the sacred right of all free people's, and the people of the UK have exercised that right for all the world to see.
America is proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder w/a free and ind UK. We stand together as friends, as allies, and as a people w/a shared history.
New Government data by the Center for Immigration Studies shows more than 3M new legal and illegal immigrants settled..
I want all Americans to succeed together. President Obama's illegal executive amnesty undermines job prospects for...
Crooked Hillary called it totally wrong on BREXIT - she went with Obama - and now she is saying we need her to lead. She would be a disaster
The opening of Trump Turnberry in Scotland was a big success. Good timing, I was here for BREXIT. Very exciting news conference today!
Many people are equating BREXIT, and what is going on in Great Britain, with what is happening in the U.S. People want their country back!
"@DarrenWaggener: @realDonaldTrump What has happened in the UK in the last 12 hours is exactly what will happen in November..vote TRUMP 2016
"@Jolena3: @realDonaldTrump And we will get it back once we have President Trump! Can't wait!"
Thoughts and prayers are with everyone in West Virginia- dealing with the devastating floods. #ImWithYou
So funny, Crooked Hillary called BREXIT so incorrectly, and now she says that she is the one to deal with the U.K. All talk, no action!
Arriving @TrumpScotland with @DonaldJTrumpJr and @EricTrump. Back to New York tonight. Video:
On the 13th tee box @TrumpScotland with my grand daughter, Kai! @DonaldJTrumpJr
Thank you to everyone who came out and joined us @TrumpTurnberry yesterday! @EricTrump @IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr
We must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place.
We only want to admit those who love our people and support our values. #AmericaFirst
I have never liked the media term 'mass deportation' -- but we must enforce the laws of the land!
Obama has blocked ICE officers and BP from doing their jobs. That ends when I am President!
Just landed in New York - a one night stay in Scotland. Turnberry came out magnificently. My son, Eric, did a great job - under budget!
George Will, one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago), has left the Republican Party.He's made many bad calls
Crooked Hillary Clinton, who called BREXIT 100% wrong (along with Obama), is now spending Wall Street money on an ad on my correct call.
Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on BREXIT with big dollar ads. Disgraceful!
Crooked Hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at Turnberry. Shows me hitting shot, but I never did = lie! Was there to support son
The @ABC poll sample is heavy on Democrats.  Very dishonest - why would they do that? Other polls good!
Top 50 Facts About Crooked Hillary Clinton From Trump 'Stakes Of The Election' Address:
People in our country want borders, and without them the old line pols like Crooked Hillary will not win. It is time for CHANGE -- and JOBS!
Hillary Clinton is not a change agent, just the same old status quo! She is spending a fortune, I am spending very little. Close in polls!
Crooked Hillary Clinton got Brexit wrong. I said LEAVE will win. She has no sense of markets and such bad judgement. Only a question of time
Crooked Hillary Attacks Foreign Government Donations - While Ignoring Her Own:
The "dirty" poll done by @ABC @washingtonpost is a disgrace. Even they admit that many more Democrats were polled. Other polls were good.
"@JimVitari:  @ABC @washingtonpost we know they're fake just like poles during primary. I'm sure u will crush #CrookedHillary in general"
"@brazosboys: Hillary read "sigh" off the Teleprompter, She's so fake she has to be told how to feel:  @FoxNews
"@w4djt: "Under a Trump presidency, America will make brilliant new trade deals!" Donald Trump #dtmag
"@LindaSuhler: Trump voters don't scare or back down. Our numbers are growing and we're taking our country BACK. #Trump2016 #MAGA
Crooked Hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the U.S. Senate, goofy Elizabeth Warren, who lied on heritage.
The media is unrelenting. They will only go with and report a story in a negative light. I called Brexit (Hillary was wrong), watch November
.@CNN is all negative when it comes to me. I don't watch it anymore.
"@GovBrewer: I'll be a guest today on Making Money with @cvpayne on @ Fox Business 6 PM ET / 3 PM PT Discussing @realDonaldTrump. Tune in!"
"@vegas_sports: Good for @realDonaldTrump he's smart on business. Maybe If corporations weren't overtaxed they would stay. Voting for #Trump
"@Patricia_Graf:  @GovBrewer @cvpayne let's get Trump supporters out in massive numbers and make America Great Again - create jobs"

Benghazi is just another Hillary Clinton failure. It justnever seems to work the way it's supposed to with Clinton.
Hillary Clintons Presidency would be catastrophic forthe future of our country. She is ill-fit with bad judgment.
Yet another terrorist attack, this time in Turkey. Willthe world ever realize what is going on? So sad.
We must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the United States.
"@jtsbk:  @AllenWest thanks for sharing Eric we need @realDonaldTrump now as this administration is incapable of keeping our country safe"
Iron Mike Tyson was not asked to speak at the Convention though I'm sure he would do a good job if he was. The media makes everything up!
The @USCHAMBER must fight harder for the American worker. China, and many others, are taking advantage of U.S. with our terrible trade pacts
Why would the USChamber be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that I want penalties for cheaters?
Just watched Senator John Barrasso on @FoxNews - He was great! Thank you John.
New Q poll out- we are going to win the whole deal- and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #Trump2016
Will be in Bangor, Maine today! Join me- 4pmE at the Cross Insurance Center!
ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!
I will be on @oreillyfactor at 8:00 P.M. Enjoy!
"@Gengm7: @jakeda @realDonaldTrump As of April this year, Hillary had spent $264,000,000 on her campaign Mr.Trump $55,000,000. self funding"
Tremendous day in Massachusetts and Maine. Thank you to everyone for making it so special!
For reasons only they can explain, the @USChamber wants to continue our bad trade deals rather than renegotiating and making them better.
The story with Hillary will never change.
New book by @ericbolling is absolutely terrific and a must read! #WakeUpAmerica
Why would college graduates want Crooked Hillary as their President? She will destroy them!
